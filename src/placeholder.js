# Paragraphs 

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.


# Line breaks

This is the first line.  
And this is the second line. 


# Emphasis

I just love **bold text**.

Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

This text is ***really important & bold and italic at the same time***.


# Blockquotes

> To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

## Nested Blockquotes

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
